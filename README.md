# VINder.ai Matching Engine

**VINder** is an AI-powered vehicle recommendation system that matches customer leads to real-world inventory using structured feature matrices, weighted scoring logic, and behavior-based personalization. Designed for buyers, sales teams, and OEMs.

---

## ðŸš— How it Works

VINder takes customer leads (preferences like color, roof type, model) and matches them against dealer inventory using:

- âœ… Real trim-level feature validation (Lucid, Tesla, Rivian, Polestar)
- âœ… Weighted scoring system across 11 features
- âœ… Region-scoped filtering (North, East, South, West)
- âœ… Match vs mismatch logging
- âœ… Behavioral modifiers (views, favorites, contact intent)
